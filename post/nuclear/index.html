<p>Vamos começar pegando um mapa-mundi. Para nossa conveniência existe um nos pacotes <code>ggplot</code> e <code>maps</code>. Plotamos esse mapa usando a função <code>geom_polygon()</code> e vamos usar o tema <code>theme_map</code> do pacote <code>ggthemes</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>world &lt;- ggplot2::map_data(&quot;world&quot;)

world %&gt;% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  coord_quickmap() +
  ggthemes::theme_map()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-08-21-nuclear/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Agora vamos colocar as explosões nucleares e usar as variáveis <code>size</code> e <code>color</code> pra nos trazer mais informações. A função <code>coord_quickmap()</code>, como o nome indica, é boa pra visualizações rápidas. Não é exatamente equivalente a nenhuma das projeções comumente vistas em cartografia.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world %&gt;% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill = &quot;gray95&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) +
  geom_point(data = nuclear,
             aes(x = longitude,
                 y = latitude,
                 size = yield_lower,
                 color = country),
             alpha = 0.45) +
  labs(size = &quot;Quilotons&quot;,
       color = &quot;País&quot;) +
  ylim(-90, 90) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = &quot;qual&quot;, palette = 1) +
  coord_quickmap() +
  ggthemes::theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-08-21-nuclear/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Parece que a URSS foi campeã em testes nucleares em território próprio. Vamos dar um zoom no território da (hoje) Rússia usando <code>xlim</code> e <code>ylim</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world %&gt;% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill = &quot;gray95&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) +
  geom_point(data = nuclear,
             aes(x = longitude,
                 y = latitude,
                 size = yield_lower,
                 color = country),
             alpha = 0.45) +

       color = &quot;País&quot;) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = &quot;qual&quot;, palette = 1) +
  xlim(range(world %&gt;% 
               filter(region == &quot;Russia&quot;) %&gt;% 
               pull(long))) +
  ylim(range(world %&gt;% 
               filter(region == &quot;Russia&quot;) %&gt;% 
               pull(lat))) +

<p><img src="/post/2019-08-21-nuclear/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Parece que o alvo preferido da URSS eram as ilhas de Yuzhni e Severny, no Ártico. Não a toa o Ártico foi o maior palco da Guerra Fria.</p>
<p>Curiosidade: Sabiam que os EUA tentaram comprar a Groenlândia da Dinamarca logo depois da II Guerra Mundial, em 1946, já prevendo a importância de fortalecer sua posição no ártico?</p>
<p>Isso serve como deixa pra usar a projeção “Azimutal Equidistante” no próximo gráfico, usando a função <code>coord_map()</code> do <code>ggplot2</code>, que usa as projeções da terra definidas no pacote <code>mapproj</code>. Filtrei só o hemisfério norte pra esse caso. Essa projeção mantém as distâncias em relação ao pólo, mas distorce as áreas.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world %&gt;% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill = &quot;gray95&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) +
  geom_point(data = nuclear,
             aes(x = longitude,
                 y = latitude,
                 size = yield_lower,
                 color = country),
             alpha = 0.45) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(size = &quot;Quilotons&quot;,
       color = &quot;País&quot;) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = &quot;qual&quot;, palette = 1) +
  ylim(0, 90) +
  coord_map(projection = &quot;azequidistant&quot;) +
  ggthemes::theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-08-21-nuclear/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Dá pra entender melhor como esses testes da URSS foram todos “no quintal” dos EUA, né?</p>
<p>Agora vou deixar o mapa com uma cara um pouco mais profissional, baixando dados de melhor qualidade do pacote <code>rworldmap</code>, usando as funções do pacote <code>sf</code>, deixando o mapa com melhor qualidade. Pra mudar pra mais uma projeção, vamos usar a de Mercator dessa vez. Essa é a projeção das mais comuns, que mantém os meridianos como linhas verticais e, consequentemente, distorce todas as áreas proporcionalmente à latitude. Vou transformar nossos pontos em uma simple feature para poder converter ela na projeção de Mercator.</p>
